Subnets:
    3 Private subnets in 3 different AZ. Each subnets have the same ACLS
        * NOTE: bad idea to use prefixlist for ACL network rules. This changes and causes problems

Route Tables
    private subnets. Route table to route locally within the VPC
    Squid Subnets 

security groups
   master group
   worker group
   Note: most of the communication is only allowed as long as the source is either one of these security group. Exceptions to these rules are
       * icmp can come from anywhere within the VPC
       * ssh can come from anywhere within the VPC??? maybe we dont need this

Instance IAM roles
    Master-role
        load balancer IAM roles are needed because the cloud controller needs to create a load balancer and mantain the targets
        for the openshift router pods which are exposed via a "loadbalancer" kubernetes service which in turns creates an ELB
    Worker-role
