this is just a module needed for POC at home because I need internet connectivity through a proxy. This module is not needed and should not be used for real AWS accounts.

The following domains are whitelisted for functiolity
iam.amazonaws.com = needed for communication with iam
route53.amazonaws.com = needed for installer and cluster functionalty
tagging.us-east-1.amazonaws.com = needed for ingress operator to find the elb
